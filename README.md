## A simple html ,css and javascript dice game

**Hello world!**

_One common pitfall of modern browser games is that they are heavily resource reliant_

> What my project aims to do is provide a simple fun multiplayerthat doesn't put much strain on the computer's memory and cpu

## Use of a public API to fetch pokemon data

**fetches data from pokemon API available at [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/)**

> In the true spirit of gaming,what better way to be entertained than having your favorite pokemon character displayed on the screen as you play the game

### example code block

```js
const apiData = {
  url: "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/",
  type: "pokemon",
  //   if you change the ID,it'll change the pokemon displayed
  id: "25",
};
```
